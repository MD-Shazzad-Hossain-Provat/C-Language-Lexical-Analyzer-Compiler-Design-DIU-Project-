# C-Language-Lexical-Analyzer-Compiler-Design-DIU-Project-
This project implements a Lexical Analyzer for the C programming language as part of the Compiler Design course. The program reads C source code, identifies tokens, validates identifiers using regular expressions, and generates a complete symbol table. It also handles errors, unknown lexemes, and writes the final output to a file.
